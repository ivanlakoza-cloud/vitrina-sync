Vitrina Sync — Fix r2 (2025‑09‑01)
==================================
Files are placed at repo ROOT (no wrapping folder).

Changes:
1) lib/fields.ts
   - FieldOrder widened to { sort_order: number; display_name_ru?: string; visible?: boolean }

2) app/data.ts
   - fetchFieldOrder(): set only known keys; default visible to true if missing from VIEW

3) app/o/[external_id]/page.tsx
   - label overrides now built with reduce() to include only defined strings:
     Record<string, string>, no undefined → fixes TS error at line 63

Notes:
- SWC warnings on Vercel are benign. To silence, run `next` locally once (it patches lockfile).
- After import/commit, CI should pass `npm run build`.
